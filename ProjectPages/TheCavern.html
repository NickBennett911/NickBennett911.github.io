					<h2>What was the goal?</h2>
				</header>
				<body>
					<a class="image right"><img src="../images/GIFS/TheCavern/StartOfGame.gif" /></a>
					<p2>
						The original goal of this project was quite simple, make a game for a school project to learn the basic in's and 
						out's of Unreal engine. But with continuted hard work and time being poured into the project by my partner and 
						I we decided we wanted to try and take it and work on it past the end of the semester. We wanted to try and 
						finish the game and get it put onto Steam since that seemed like a huge achievement to the both of us. We started 
						off with laying out what we wanted to make. We both talked about how interesting a challenge making a horror game 
						might be. We layed out a brief outline of how we wanted to game to play and some ideas for mechanics. With some 
						light groundwork down we hit the ground running.

					<h2>My approach</h2>
				</header>
				<body>
					<p2>
					 With the outline layed out we knew that we also needed to come up with roles for ourselves so that we didnt end up
					 stepping on each others toes. It worked out quite nice actually, my partner knew that he really liked lighting and
					 map design and the some of technical art aspects that go along with those. As for me I knew that I was very passionate
					 about the systems and mechanics programming and so I undertook all the programming for the game (including: 
					 all the ghost logic, the main driving progressions systems, movement, menu systems, main menu, sounds, win and lose
					 conditions, etc). It seemed a bit daunting having all the programming on my shoulders, but I was very excited about 
					 the challenge. It is also worth noting that one requirment for this project was using Unreal's blueprint system.
					 <br/><br/>

					 While my partner worked on the map layout in our main level using some nice assets we found on the Unreal market
					 I decided to start prototyping in my own size level. I knew that the ghost for the game would be the main centerpiece
					 so I started on that first. I started by thinking about other horror games and what makes them scary. Aside from 
					 sounds which is always important they all also seemed to utilize jump scares and some kind of chase mechanic. The jump
					 scare doing well immediate scares and the chasing doing the "edge of the seat kinda suspense" as the player tries to
					 run away. So I went about implimenting these behaviours for our ghost. He sometimes spawns in front of player and 
					 chases them and can also spawn behind the player to do the same thing. With just these two mechancis we realized quickly
					 that it wasnt enough at all, they worked but they got too repetative.<br/><br/>

					 So I did some more research (aka played some horror games) and also found that in some games every scary moment that 
					 happens doesnt involve the player getting directly attacked. A lot of the time the main enemy will just walk past a hallway
					 ahead of them or some kind of object will do the scaring. So I also decided to try and adopt these two mechanics. I started
					 with the "ghost objects" which were pretty simple. I made a basic blueprint that could be given any mesh and when the player
					 gets within an adjustable range the object would get thrown at somewhat towards the player.<br/><br/>

					 I decided to tackle the "ghost wondering" next. This was a little more challenging because I realized you couldnt just
					 spawn the ghost in randomly and give him a random direction to move since he might just spawn and walk right into a wall
					 never getting seen by the player. So I made a little algorithm that runs everytime the ghost goes to spawn in. Once the
					 location within the map gets selected a ray is shot downwards until it hits the floor so we can spawn the ghost there and 
					 he isnt too high or too low into the ground. Once we have that a number or rays get shot out in a circle around that point.
					 The reason for this is that we can keep track of how far each of those rays travel before hitting a wall. With this we
					 are able to tell which direction has the most space for the ghost to travel. In other words the ray with the farthest 
					 distance to its hit is the direction that the ghost travels in. This increases the odds of the ghost getting seen by
					 the player much much higher.

					</div> 
					<br/>
					The clip on the left demonstrates out object based gameplay. The paper by the fire gives the player three objectives
					in the cave to locate and as the player does that they get scratched off the paper. As this happens the ghost also 
					gets more aggresive, the more objectives the more aggresive.<br/><br/>

					The clip on the right deomstrates our "fear" mechanic. As the player looks at the ghost they build up fear which shows 
					itself as the player lossing their vision (this is also the death condition, if the player losses their sight all the 
					way they die as a result). The clip also shows how the fire is like the players safe zone because it
					strips away the fear much much faster than it goes away natrually.

					<h2>Challenges Faced and Things Learned</h2>
				</header>
				<body>
					<p2>
					  The greatest challenge that I personally faced was the fact that I was the only programmer. Having the weight of 
						all the programming for the game on my shoulders got a bit heavy every now and then. It really made me push myself 
						in my time management abilities and just programming skills in general. I had to be more efficient with the code I wrote, 
						making sure that a system or chunk of code didnt end up taking too many recourses for a frame.<br/><br/>
						
						Another main challenge both my partner and I had to deal with is how this game was pretty much our first experience
						in doing something semi large scale in Unreal engine. We had limited experience with using it prior, but we had 
						done nothing like this before. So naturally there were hurdles that needed to be jumped over and things we had to learn
						as we went along. But because we did our own research on the topics we did not know, I became that much stronger 
						on that particular topic. It could become grueling at the time, but looking back, it has made me all that much better
						at using Unreal
