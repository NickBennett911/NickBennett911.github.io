					<h2>What was the goal?</h2>
				</header>
				<body>
					<p2>
						The goal for this little project was to make a solver that I could give a Cryptarithm and it would solve it,
						giving me all the possible solutions for the input. Since not every Cryptarithm has just one solution. I also 
						wanted to take into account the potential for leading zeros in numbers and if they are allowed or not since 
						that will also greatly change the number of solutions.

					<h2>My approach</h2>
				</header>
				<body>
					<p2>
						For this apprach I went ahead and took a brute force approach. Firstly I went ahead an took the input 
						and extracted all the unique letters from it. Once that information is attained I need to get all possible
						permutations of the 0-9 number combinations. This way we can check the permutations to find which of them fit 
						for the input given. This is done like so: 
						<section style="text-align:left;">
<pre><code>from itertools import permutations

inp = input("Input at least 3 words all separated by once space: ")
inp = inp.split(" ")

letters = CreateUniqueLettersList(inp)  # create the unique letters from the input given

# create all possible permutations from the unique letters
possible = list(permutations([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], len(letters)))
</code></pre>
						</section>

						The acutal permutations come in to play with the itertools function "permutation()". This function allows us 
						to give it a list of options, in this case our possible 0-9 digits, and then a number n. What this does is give us
						all the possible ways we can have a combination of length n of the list given. A smaller example of this might look
						like this:
						<section style="text-align:left;">
<pre><code>from itertools import permutations

# create all possible permutations
possible = list(permutations([0, 1, 2], 2))

# possible = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [0, 2]]
</code></pre>
						</section>

						Once we have all the possible permutations for the numbers the rest is pretty strait forward. We check each and
						every one to see if that permutation is a valid option for the Cryptarithm given. This is done using the function
						described 

						<section style="text-align:left;">
<pre><code>def IsValuePermutation(perm_nums, words, letters, LeadingZeros):
	'''
	Check to see if permutation is a valid one given the words and unique letters
	:param perm_nums: permutation being checked i.e. a list of numbers
	:param words: a list of our words that was given to us
	:param letters: the unique letters for the given words
	:param LeadingZeros: tells us if we are allowing leading zeros or not
	:return: True if possible, False otherwise
	'''
	lookup = CreateLookUp(letters, perm_nums)   # create our lookup table to be passed
	WordsAsNums = []
	for word in words:
			num = WordToNum(word, lookup)
			if LeadingZeros != "Yes":
					if len(str(num)) < len(word):   # this means we had a leading zero so we return false
							return (False, [])
			WordsAsNums.append(num)

	result = 0
	for i in range(len(WordsAsNums)-1): # add up our results except for the last
			result += WordsAsNums[i]

	if result == WordsAsNums[-1]:   # if our addition matches then return true
			return (True, WordsAsNums)
	return (False, [])
</code></pre>
						</section>

						To break this down a bit I will describe it chunk by chunk. Firstly what we will do is create our own 
						little look up table to make things easier. What this does is create a dictionary from our unique letters and 
						the current permutation of numbers being checked so that we may easily look up a number associated with a letter.
						After this what we want to do is convert all the words from the input into numbers using that lookup table. This 
						can be done very easiy using some fancy python syntax like so:

						<section style="text-align:left;">
<pre><code>def WordToNum(word, lookup):
	return int("".join(str(lookup[letter]) for letter in word))
</code></pre>
						</section>

						Then once we have all the words into their numbers for the permutation we simply check to additions of the 
						numbers to see if they match and if so then we can say for certain that the permutation is one that words.

					<h2>Challenges Faced and Things Learned</h2>
				</header>
				<body>
					<p2>
					  The largets challenge for this was not neccessarily the algorithm in particular but how to do it quickly and 
						in a consise way. Along with this came the challenge of understanding itertools' permutation() function 
						and how to use that and apply it to this situation correctly. But for me what I was really trying to do with this 
						was see how cleverly I could solve the problem as well as how concisely and neatly I could write the code to do it.

				<body>
					<p2>The source code is up on my GitHub for you to download if you'd like to check it out! Along with this the project
						is also on replit.com so that you can run it that way as well! (NOTE: Due to how the replit website works,
						running the code there will increase runtime)
