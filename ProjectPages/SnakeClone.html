						The goal of this project for me was to create my very own snake clone, but that seemed just a bit too easy 
						for me. So to spice things up a bit I only gave myself two and a half hours to finish to clone. At the time I 
						was working as a supplemental instructor on campus and my shift was quite dead. So I decided that with two
						and a half hours left on the clock I'd try and make my very own snake clone!

					<h2>My approach</h2>
				</header>
				<body>
					<p2>
						Due to the extreme time constraint I put on myself I wasnt able to due my usual method planning things out. So 
						instead I just had to start typing right away. Using the pygame library as me graphics the first things I tackled
						was the play area. I needed something that my furture player was going to navigate around. So like all Snake games
						I created a 2D grid of tile objects that was wrapped up neatly inside of a Map object. The main purpose of this 
						map object was the manage everything to do with the tile's, largly including the food tile. This was all farily
						rutine work however, the real fun came when I actually started on the player.<br/><br/>

						The intelectual challange of coming up with how I'd be able to get the unique movement of Snake in such a 
						short period of time was actually quite fun. My first iteration of Snake movement ended up having all parts of the 
						snake move in the same directions at the same time. I realized instantly that I'd have to think a little outside 
						the box for this one. Since when thinking about Snake, the movement almost cascades down the snake in a way. For example,
						if you are moving up and move to the right its almost as if the head of the snake drops a kind of "beacon" that 
						tells future parts of the snake, that get to it's location, that they need to also move to the right.<br/><br/>

						That way of thinking is how I approached the issue. I essentially made a queue of "directions" inside my player object.
						This queue (which really was just an array) held info at each element for where the direction was changed, what direction 
						was actually pressed and most importantly how many player cells the direction has affected. This way, each time the player went
						to move this queue got checked, and whichever player cell was at that location then that cell got its direction changed to the 
						new direction and so on providing the cascade effect. Then when the number of effected player cells for that direction
						becomes equal to the number of cells in the player that direction can be deleted since it no longer needs to be used.

						The end result looks something like this:
					</p2>
					<a class="image"><img src="../images/GIFS/SnakeClone/SnakeWiggle.gif"/></a>
					<p2>
						<br/>
						As you can tell this sort of movement algorithm that I came up with on the fly provided the perfect solution 
						to the issue that I was having. There are lots more details that are definitely worth checking out too! All the way 
						from how the snake grows after eating food to how the actual tile objects themselves are handled with being player owned
						or not and each tile having its own independent direction which I actually mentioned briefly above.

					<h2>Challenges Faced and Things Learned</h2>
				</header>
				<body>
					<p2>
						The main challenge for me in doing this self project was the time constraint coupled with the creative thinking
						needed for snake movement problem. Thankfully, like most projects, the greatest challenge also turned into the 
						greatest take-away. It forced me to think of some creative solutions to a farily odd problem in a timely manner
						which is always a great skill to have practive with and get better at.
