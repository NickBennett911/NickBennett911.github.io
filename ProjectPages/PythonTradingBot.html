					<h2>What was the goal?</h2>
				</header>
				<body>
					<p2>
						My goal for this project was to be able to make a program that would be able to buy and sell crypto 
						or stocks based on whether or not it thought it was a beneficial to do so. I've been into the crypto and 
						stock market for about a year now as a very light side hobby. I thought this project would be a great
						chance to utilize several different skills all at once and hopefully even make something that worked well in
						the end.

					<h2>My approach</h2>
				</header>
				<body>
					<p2>
						Since I was starting quite literally from scratch for this project I had to think about where to actually start.
						Before I started anything to even do with programming I wanted to have a bit more background knowledge. So I started 
						doing some research on some different methods for determing when is a good time to buy or sell a crypto or stock. 
						I quickly notice the term "Relative Strength Index" (RSI) popping up a lot in my research. Using a crypto or stock's
						RSI is a very common trading strategy. RSI index, in short, is a number between 0 and 100. This number represents 
						how "strong" the ticker at hand is; in other words if the RSI is low then it's "strong" (i.e. its a good time to 
						buy) and if the RSI is low then its "weak" (i.e. its a good time to sell). Now how do we actually find the RSI 
						for a given time? The formula for RSI is as follows:

						<section style="text-align:left;">
<pre><code># avg_gain - the average price gain over a period of time before present
# avg_loss - the average price loss over a period of time before present
RSvalue = (avg_gain / avg_loss)       # relative strength
RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RSvalue))     # relative strenght index
</code></pre>
						</section>

						</br>
						Now that I had most of the foundational knowledge for the subject, and what I wanted to use to actually make my
						buy/sell decisions on, I could move on. Though it didn't take long until I hit another very obvious brick wall.
						How was I actually going to get any market information or buy and sell anything for that matter? So I took to the 
						internet again, but this time, looking for an API that I could use (needed to be a Robinhood API since
						that is what I was using for my trading) to bridge the gap between my bot and the actual markets. Thas how I stumbled 
						across the API called <a href="https://robin-stocks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">Robin Stocks</a>. 
						This API allowed me to access Robinhood, more specifically my own Robinhood account, in my code and interact 
						with it in several different ways. This included: loging into my account, accessing historics (past information)
						on a stock or crypto and buy/selling both stocks and cryptos. Here is a little snippit of what using Robin Stocks might
						look like:
						
						<section style="text-align:left;">
<pre><code>from robin_stocks import robinhood

TICKER = "DOGE"      # the ticker that we want to get info on
SPAN = 'month'       # how far back we are looking
INTERVAL = 'hour'    # how often we sample past info while going back in time
	
# login to your own robinhood account (checkout robin stocks for details on the mfa_code)
robinhood.authentication.login(EMAIL, PASSWORD, mfa_code=CODE)
# historics contains 744 elements with each one being a collection of data from a specific point in time
# the robinhood function, in this case, will get info from every hour in the past month
Historics = robinhood.get_crypto_historicals(TICKER.upper(), interval=INTERVAL, span=SPAN)
print(Historics[0])
	
# output
# {'begins_at': '2021-12-03T02:00:00Z', 'open_price': '0.209573', 'close_price': '0.207278', 'high_price': '0.210370', 'low_price': '0.206136', 'volume': 0, 'session': 'reg', 'interpolated': False, 'symbol': 'DOGEUSD'}
</code></pre>
						</section>	

						</br>
						Once I got familiar with the API and the functions that I knew that I would be needing I was able to start 
						on the actual bot part. The first thing I wanted to do was put to use the RSI research I did. Putting together a lot 
						of different helper functions to make my own little wrapper around the API and using those to make RSI calculations in 
						a larger scale, but still using the formula above. Once I was able to produce a RSI for every point in time in my historics
						I was able to use the MatPlotLib library to make a line chart so the info was easier to see. Now with all the ground work 
						layed out I needed to decide what all I wanted my bot to be able to do. The list I came up with looked something like:
						</br>
						1. All variables and paramaters need to be adjustable to cater to different cryptos and stocks</br>
						2. The Bot would check to see if it wants to purchase over a certain period determined by the user</br>
						3. The Bot would make its buy/sell decision based on the current RSI value of the ticker</br>
						4. There needs to be some kind of info shown to the user on the fly so at a glance they could tell what's happened</br>
						5. A summary of each program lifetime would get saved off to a file to keep a record for future look back</br>
						6. Some kind of manual buy/sell mode in case the user wants to manual take action</br></br>

						I was able to impliment everything that I had on my list for the bot. Full disclosure, however, making decisions 
						souly based on a RSI can only be so accurate. This bot is by no means perfect and I would not recommend using it 
						when large quantities of currency is in question. One other feature I decided to add was a way to check the accuracy
						of the algorithms used. I check a lot of different stats that the program comes up with. One way of checking these 
						things is by counting the number of True/False Positives/Negatives and calculating the accuracy of the predictions. 
						Jumping over a lot of the specifics the end results come out to be very good a majority of the time and not so good 
						some of the other times. This is because I am only taking the RSI into account, and while this can yeild some good results 
						a good portion of the time it is not perfect. This is why I wanted all the variables and parameters to be adjustable,
						because what might be a good span, interval and lookback period (inspect code on github for more details) for one 
						ticker might not be good at all for another. This way with all the tools provided a user can find a set of parameters
						that work best for the ticker they are trading.

					<h2>Challenges Faced and Things Learned</h2>
				</header>
				<body>
					<p2>
					  This project presented me with many challenges. Some of those challenges include: learning a new api from scratch,
					  teaching myself different trading strategies, coding trading strategies, calculating many different detailed statistics 
						from raw market data, and managing all the raw market data necessary. There was no one individual that stood out as 
						much harder than the others, because all of them were equally hard to accomplish and even harder to intertwine together.
						They all required their own unique solution, wheather that was a programming solution or a way of thinking solution.
						All these solutions in one way or another was outside of my comfort zone and while it was hard and sometimes stressful
						in the moment I am all the better, more wellrounded, and skilled for it. From learning different self teaching strategies
						that work for myself to the knowledge gained about the stock and crypto market to the programming skills atained from 
						working outside of my comfort zone and trying new things. Everything had me learning something new and becoming all
						the better for it.
