					<h1>Where Am I From?</h1>
					<p>I'm from a small town called Goshen Ohio just a little ways away from Cinncinnati.
						I've lived nearly my entire life in Goshen and it wasnt until I decided to attend
						Shawnee State University that I got to live away from home. Goshen is a typical small
						suburban town that doesnt have too much to offer. I attended our very own Goshen
						High School which, contrary to what one might think, was actually a really good school
						primarily due to its teachers and the love they had for their jobs. </p>

					<h2>What Drives Me?</h2>
					<p>My entier life I was always taught that you get out of life what you put in to it. Meaning
						the harder you work the more succesfull you'll be. I'll be the first to admit that I didn't always
						think too much about what this meant and didn't used to put very much into life. It wasn't until maybe
						halfway though high school that I realized I needed to really start putting more into my own life if
						I wanted to actually get something out of it. Every since then I've always tried to do my best to stand
						out and challenge myself wherever possible. Whether it be working on something in my free time or going the
						extra mile on a lab in a college class.
					</p>
					<p>In particular though I just really enjoy coding. I get lost in my own projects or a coding
						assignment all the time. Often working far too late into the night trying to get a bug fixed or a new
						feature working. Ultimately, wanting to stand out in the crowd and really challenge myself is what drives me
						to always push myself.
					</p>
