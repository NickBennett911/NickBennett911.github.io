					<p2>Feel free to peruse all my projects as you'd like. This list contains some things
						  that were souly school projects that I feel showcase particular skills and knowledge.
							However, there are also many projects that I tackled on my own and in my own time. This includes
							projects that I took beyond the scope of an assignment as a form of self teaching to 
							further myself in a certain area.

						This is my Senior Class Project, it's our final, year long, game that gets made by all the artists and programmers
						in our class. This is the largest and longest project that we get to work on in my particular degree. We put 
						to use anything and everything that we've learned over the course of our education. As well as use the set 
						of skills we have and the tools we've learned to step outside the box of things we've done to do new and different 
						things to challenge ourselves. My roles on the team include: Networking Engineer, Weapons/Inventory System developer, 
						Enemy AI developer, and General Systems Programmer. I encourage you to take a look at the work I've done for the game so far!

					<p>
						As a fun little challenge I decided to try my hand at making a Cryptarithm solver. If you are unfamiliar with 
						what a Cryptarithm is here is a brief explanation. The goal is to give words or combinations of letters and 
						"add" them up where all unique letters represent a unique number 0-9. For example lets do something like this:
						SEND + MORE = MONEY. In this case the only solution would be 9567 + 1085 = 10652.

					<p>
						For about a year prior to this project I have been into the stock and cryto market. Investing has become
						a bit of a side hobby for me. So I decided why not combine my new side hobby with my programming skills.
						I created this automated trading bot that will auto buy and sell the given ticker based on its Relative 
						Strength Index (RSI). All info is gathered by me and all the statistics are calculated by me on the fly 
						while the program runs. I use Robinhood and an API for it called Robin Stocks to connect everything together.

						With this game engine, we started with Ogre as our graphics library wrapper and a handfull of basic goals to hit and 
						we went to town. This engine, I feel, hits a lot on some of my skills as a programmer. Demonstrating skills, including:
						Singletons, OOP, Custom Scripting, Custom Game Objects, Object Managers, Custom Physics Integration, Collision
						Integration, Scene Parsing, Custom Component System, Logging, Input Bindings, etc.

						This was actually a horror game that a buddy of mine and I started together as a project for school to learn Unreal
						with him as our level designer and asset manager and myself as the soul programmer for the game. 
						However, we both had so much fun making the game and liked it so much we decided to take it a little bit further, actually 
						working on it outside of the semester with the hope of getting it up on Steam. Unfortunately, due 
						to the difficulty and hoops that you have to be jumped through to get something on steam this didnt happen. However, 
						the game did reach a nice finishing point which we were both still quite happy with.

					<p>As a small self project during winter break my sophmore year I decided to do some reasearch and make my own
						little program that shows two pathfinding algorithms at work: A* and Breath-First_Search.
						This was a great experience and I learned a lot about graphs and algorithms in general.</p>

					<p> There are some things that are a right of passage for a programmer, and to me one of those
						is making a snake clone. I took a couple creative liberties of my own and the snake type movement
						was really fun to figure out. Over all it was a really short and beneficial project that provided
