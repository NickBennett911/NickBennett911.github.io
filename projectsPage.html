					<p2>Feel free to peruse all my projects as you'd like. This list contains some things
						  that were souly school projects that I feel showcase particular skills and knowledge.
							However, there are also many projects that I tackled on my own and in my own time. This includes
							projects that I took beyond the scope of a assignment as a form of self teaching to 
							further myself in a certain area.

					</header>
					<a href="ProjectPages/PathfindingPage.html" class="image fit"><img src="images/GIFS/Pathfinding/A-Star.gif" alt="" /></a>
					<p>As a small self project during winter break my sophmore year I decided to do some reasearch and make my own
						little program that shows two pathfinding algorithms at work: A* and Breath-First_Search.
						This was a great experience and I learned a lot about graphs and algorithms in general.</p>

					<a href="ProjectPages/SudokoPage.html" class="image fit"><img src="images/GIFS/Sudoku/SudokuSolvingGif.gif" alt="" /></a>
					<p>This is a self project I did to challenge and better myself in function recursion. Since this is a subject many
						have a very lose grasp on, I decided it would be a short and very beneficial project to work on. And yes
						it solves ANY solvable sudoku board.</p>

					<p>Game Jams are a great way to challenge yourself. In this case I worked mostly on the game mechanices, but
						for me my biggest take away from this was the time management skills aquired from the small time frame and
						the small
						group of people.</p>

					<a href="https://github.com/NickBennett911/FirstUnityGameJam/tree/main" class="image fit"><img src="images/UnityGameJame.PNG" alt="" /></a>
					<p>With this game jam, me and my small group really wanted to challenge ourselves by diving into Unity for the
						very first time. I worked on the second level of the game as well as doing a bulk of the coding for the
						players and enemies</p>

					<p> There are some things that are a right of passage for a programmer, and to me one of those
						is making a snake clone. I took a couple creative liberties of my own and the snake type movement
						was really fun to figure out.</p>

					<p>This is the first long project I've worked on in a group. This was done during
